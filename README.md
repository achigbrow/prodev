# Passion Project
My passion, my why, is that I want to contribute meaningfully to our world. I can best do this by building tools that help people to do their jobs better. My focus is on the scientific and educational fields. I use my 'logic' by devising tools and methods that are simple and efficient. I use my 'feeling' through empathy with my end user. What are their trials? How can I help them? What do they need/want?
